# Department & Position Dropdowns - Always Visible Update

## Changes Made

### What Changed:
The department and position dropdown menus are now **always visible** on your profile page (when viewing your own profile), positioned on the **right side** of the profile info section, exactly where you marked.

### Key Features:

1. **Always Visible**: Dropdowns are now permanently visible when you're on your own profile - no need to click "Edit Profile"

2. **Auto-Save**: Changes are saved automatically when you select:
   - A department (HR, Developer, Design)
   - A position (dynamically changes based on department)

3. **Right-Side Positioning**: The dropdowns are positioned on the right side of the profile section, separated from your name and photo

4. **Smart Behavior**:
   - Select department first → Position dropdown appears
   - Change department → Position resets automatically
   - Each selection saves immediately to the database

### Visual Layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Photo]  Your Name              │  [Department Dropdown]   │
│           2 posts                 │  [Position Dropdown]     │
│           [HR] [HR Manager]       │  (Always visible)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Technical Details:

#### Files Modified:

1. **frontend/src/Profile.jsx**:
   - Removed the `isEditing` condition for dropdowns
   - Added auto-save functionality to both dropdowns
   - Wrapped profile photo and details in a flex container
   - Dropdowns update the database immediately on change

2. **frontend/src/Profile.css**:

   - Updated `.profile-info-section` to use flexbox layout
   - Modified `.profile-role-selection` positioning to right side
   - Added responsive design for smaller screens
   - Dropdowns stack vertically on mobile

### How It Works:

2. **Select Department**: Click dropdown, choose HR/Developer/Design
   - Saves automatically
   - Position dropdown appears
3. **Select Position**: Choose your specific role
