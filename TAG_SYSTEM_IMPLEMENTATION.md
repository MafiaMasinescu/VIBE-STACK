## How to Use

### Setting Your Role Tag:
1. Go to your Profile page
2. Click "Edit Profile"
3. Go to the "About" tab
4. Select your role from the "Role Tag" dropdown
5. Click "Save"

### Creating a Tagged Post:
1. In the Feed page, type your post content
2. Select a tag from the dropdown (optional)
3. Click "Post"

### Filtering Posts by Tag:
1. In the Feed page, use the "Filter by Tag" dropdown at the top
2. Select the tag you want to filter by
3. Posts will automatically update to show only that tag

## Technical Notes

- All tag values are case-sensitive and stored as: 'HR', 'Developer', 'Design'
- Tags are optional - users and posts can have no tag
- Backend filtering is done via query parameter: `/api/posts?tag=Developer`
- All existing posts/users will have `tag: null` by default

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to extend this system, consider:
1. Adding more role options (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Management)
2. Allowing multiple tags per post
3. Adding tag statistics (e.g., "5 posts tagged HR")
4. Color-coding different tags
5. Adding tag search/autocomplete
6. Showing tag distribution in user profiles
